The design process was interactive, with strong emphasis on gameplay, engagement elements, domain literature research and direct application of common design principles for mobile.</p><img src="prototype.gif" alt="Animated GIF of a touch rhythm game prototype showing a 4x3 grid of circles. Each circle fills with color gradually, and players aim to tap when a circle is completely filled to achieve a perfect score."/><p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> <em>The prototype for the grid-style gameplay</em></p><h2>Design process</h2><p>This project was heavily based on design research rather than field research. In order to justify the purpose and approach of the app I relied heavily on literature research. Using previous research papers, specially one detailing usability testing on different play styles commonly found on rhythm games and some more on the demographics for the genre I sketched some screens on paper.</p><img src="sketch-1.webp" alt="A handwritten sketch of gameplay concepts based on "Mode #6" for a rhythm game. The central idea involves a grid layout, with diagrams exploring swipe and tap mechanics. Annotations detail various modes, such as a "Bonus mode #5" with actions like charge and jump. Other notes mention gradual darkening of nodes, sliding notes, and 4x3 grid configurations to indicate rhythms. Various gameplay elements are illustrated with arrows and lines, suggesting user interactions and timing."/><p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> <em>The actual engagement elements are distributed outside the gameplay. Adding a social competition factor to keep players coming back</em></p><img src="sketch-2.webp" alt="A handwritten sketch outlining a user interface concept for a rhythm game. The page includes various elements such as a login screen with fields for username and password, a "Featured Play Ride" section, and song selection options labeled "Servers." Annotations discuss navigation, and playlist features including play rides that rotate, leaderboard mechanics, and awarding badges to ranked players. Additional notes explore options for configuring and connecting to the service. Small diagrams illustrate layout ideas for these features."/><p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> <em>Some iterations on lanes, falling notes and grid gameplay styles</em></p><img src="sketch-3.webp" alt="A handwritten sketch detailing gameplay mechanics for a rhythm game's "beatmap." It includes a main interface showing a score area and notes appearing on the screen. Annotations describe three types of notes and roles, with notes being tappable within certain guidelines. Features like "shake to pause," countdown for resuming, and a "combo grade" with various rankings (C, B, A, S) are noted. Diagrams of paused and finished screens are sketched, emphasizing user feedback and score calculations. Annotations explore design elements and user interactions."/><p><strong>Figure 4.</strong> <em>Aside from the beat map style (the way the notes appear). I also had to consider pausing, scoring and so on</em></p><p>After I had collected enough information and made some rough sketches, the next step was to start designing the actual interactions, which were heavily reliant on design patterns, specially the ones found on Johnson’s Designing with the Mind in Mind. Interactions were designed in UXPin, and during this stage I experienced two big challenges, to get to know and handle UXPin, and incorporating a settled aesthetic for the app, which drew inspiration from outrun and retro gaming.</p><p>For the actual gameplay I had to drop UXPin and make a prototype in another app, in order to properly showcase timings, movement patterns and basically test that the grid pattern was actually fit for mobile.</p><video

In the video, a person selects the "Quick Start" option on the main menu of the "Neon Drive" app. The menu features two additional options: "Log in" and "Connect an existing account."

The user is then taken to a song selection screen that shows "Featured play ride" and a leaderboard. The featured ride is "The Queen's Croquet-Ground," available from November 15th to December 1st. Below this, there is a section to "Play a song from" with options for "YouTube," "Your Spotify library," and other services.

The user scrolls down the page, past several leaderboard entries, and then selects "The Mock Turtle's Story" as their song. A new screen appears with the song's title, artist, and a 3 out of 7 progress counter. A large button at the bottom of the screen reads "Go." The user clicks "Go," and the screen transitions to the game.

The game is a rhythm-based experience with a grid of 12 circles. The circles change color, and the player must tap them in time with the song. The user earns a "Good" rating and a combo of 212. The player pauses the game, then resumes it.

After the song ends, a "New High Score!" screen appears, showing a score of 2,631,544. The user has 1 miss, 0 bad taps, 57 fair taps, and 121 good taps. They earned a "C" combo rating. The user then navigates back to the main menu.

This limited the timeline to approximately four months, and reduced the capabilities to undergo proper usability testing and field research.</p><p>If this project took off, a product team would need to undergo usability testing on the UXPin protoype, with special emphasis on the gameplay. A graphic designer would give the interface a make up, keeping the aesthetic principles present on the prototype, while incorporating a more refined color palette, particuarly one with good contrast to font ratio, in order to make the app usable under different lightning environments. Legally speaking, the hypothetical team would need to carefully review the terms and conditions of each streaming library the app would be configured to connect with.</p><p>On the technical side, there indeed are some algorithms to convert audio files into beat maps. However, additional work would be needed in order to either convert an open-source one such as Karl O’Keeffe’s <a href="https://monket.net/dancing-monkeys/">Dancing Monkeys</a> or use previous research (like <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7352473">OSU</a>’s) to create a new algorithm from scratch.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list" aria-label="tag"><li><a href="/tags/prototyping">prototyping</a></li><li><a href="/tags/game-design">game design</a></li><li><a href="/tags/literature-review">literature review</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Portfolio made in Swift (yes, Swift!) using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish" target="_blank">Publish</a>.
