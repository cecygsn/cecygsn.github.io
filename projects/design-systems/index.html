This meant that spacing, font formatting and color meanings were not consistent thorough the platform, creating more overhead during the design and development stages to basically redo the wheel again. The project spanned three months (in-between projects). I acted as the sole designer, worked alongside C-suite stakeholders representing product and engineering and the deliverables included a JIRA wiki documentation, a Figma component and style library, and a presentation for the team to promote the new design guide.</p><h2>Context and problem</h2><p>The product had a recognizable look and feel but no formal design system, so patterns varied by team and screen. The color palette lacked semantic roles (no clear success/warning/info/interactive cues), typography was inconsistent (arbitrary header sizes, too many grays), and there were accessibility issues such as low text–foreground contrast and overly complex labels. In Figma there was no unified library, leading to duplicate components and uneven implementations.</p><p>Without a single source of truth (tokens or shared components), parallel teams often rebuilt UI elements, making it hard to standardize states and behaviors; product and engineering routinely “worked double.” This slowed delivery, raised QA churn, eroded consistency (and trust/reliability), and introduced accessibility risk. Most importantly, it didn’t scale — every new feature multiplied inconsistencies instead of compounding quality.</p><h2>Goals and success metrics</h2><ul><li>Settle inconsistencies in current UI with stakeholders</li><li>Decrease time to prototype common UI (simple forms) by &gt;30%</li><li>Create referable document that could work as a source of truth for settling small design decisions</li></ul><p>Measurement methods: Self-timed design time for form interfaces comparison pre- and post- implementation (from UI work start to first draft), wiki page views, colleagues feedback.</p><h2>Discovery and audit</h2><p>Based on a platform scan, there were 20+ tabs and 34 complex modals with client-facing UI. There was also an official color palette document with a list of 8 colors meant for marketing use. Product managers' qualitative input was also used to get a sense of copy-writing styles.</p><h3>Findings</h3><ul><li>Multiple instances of varied spacing, particularly between label/field pairs in forms and content padding inside modals</li><li>Some words were inconsistently capitalized, like using "the Platform" vs "the platform" to refer to the product (because the product was white-labeled we could not use the official name)</li><li>Dropdown menu naming conventions varied by product pod, some used a verb, some used camel case capitalization</li><li>Multiple variations of grays and sometimes other colors for titles</li><li>Consistent use of colors for different status (red for errors and required actions, yellow for paused or disabled items, blues for emphasis etc.)</li></ul><h2>Design strategy</h2><p>Here's a list of my though process alongside some examples. All visuals are reconstructed to protect client confidentiality. They reflect architecture, naming, and decisions; not proprietary UI.</p><h3>Token taxonomy</h3><ul><li>Semantic tokens with descriptions: blue.primary, blue.secondary, title, section-title, body, emphasis.</li></ul><h3>Component architecture</h3><ul><li>Table cell: Base (shape/spacing) → Variants (numeric/string) → States (default/hover/disabled/pressed).</li><li>Inputs: Field + Label + Help + Validation + error messages.</li><li><a href="https://www.figma.com/design/AM61M5zlRA01f9844aEWP1/Design-System-Demo">Link to Figma demo file</a>.</li></ul><h3>Accessibility guardrails</h3><ul><li>Color contrast (WCAG targets for text and foreground states).</li><li>Voice and tone guidelines.</li></ul><h3>Documentation</h3><ul><li>List all recommendations and design decisions (from stakeholder meetings).</li><li>Information Architecture based on feedback from the product and engineering teams (similarity matrix and hierarchical clustering) using FigJam (unmoderated closed-tree sorting) and R (for data synthesis and graphs). <img src="information-architecture-data.png" alt="The image is split in two panes. On the left is an R script that loads a tab‑separated text file assigns row and column names for 27 documentation topics: checkboxes, empty states, steppers, tooltips, typography, tabs, icons, finders, buttons, lists, text input, forms, layouts, warnings, loading, error messages, date fields, color palette, chips, static text, modals, radio buttons, sections, writing, dropdowns, and info modals. On the right is the resulting 27 by 27 numeric grid: the diagonal cells are 0, off‑diagonal cells range roughly 1–13 and represent how often participants grouped two topics together. Higher numbers indicate stronger similarity. This matrix was later converted to distances and used with multidimensional scaling (MDS) to reveal clusters that informed the documentation IA, for example, Foundations, Inputs, Feedback, and Navigation."/> <strong>Figure 1</strong> <em>R code and a 27×27 similarity matrix from a card‑sorting study used to build a design‑system information architecture</em></li><li>Waiting time indicator guidelines for less than 1500ms, between 1500ms and 200ms, and more than 200ms waiting times.</li></ul><h2>Outcomes and impact</h2><ul><li>JIRA wiki</li><li>Self-timed prototype time (for first version on similar projects) from 3 hours to 1.2 hours</li><li>List of all screens with accessibility inconsistencies for UX backlog</li><li>Presentation to engineering and product teams</li><li>Documentation queries had a constant growth of ˜3 visits/day for 4 weeks straight, or 2.2x times the total of people in the product and engineering teams</li></ul><h2>Possible improvements</h2><ul><li>Implement changelog and versions to design system</li><li>Define and name spacing tokens</li><li>Coordinate efforts with engineering to have component and tokens mirroring the design system</li></ul></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list" aria-label="tag"><li><a href="/tags/design-systems">design systems</a></li><li><a href="/tags/information-architecture">information architecture</a></li><li><a href="/tags/figma">figma</a></li><li><a href="/tags/figjam">figjam</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Portfolio made in Swift (yes, Swift!) using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish" target="_blank">Publish</a>.
