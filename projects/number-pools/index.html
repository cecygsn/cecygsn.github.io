As expected from a platform that has been more than ten years on the market, our call tracking system had evolved into a complex maze that both our internal team and clients struggled to navigate efficiently. The primary challenge was clear: users needed a more streamlined way to manage multiple tracking numbers while ensuring accurate call attribution.</p><h2>Project Constraints</h2><p>Working within established parameters, We identified several key constraints:</p><ul><li>Maintaining compatibility with existing call tracking infrastructure</li><li>Ensuring seamless integration with our current number provisioning system</li><li>Meeting a tight Q2 2024 implementation deadline</li><li>Supporting legacy tracking methods for existing clients</li></ul><h2>Design Approach</h2><p>Our focused on creating a solution that would address core user needs while considering:</p><ul><li>Interface simplification without compromising advanced functionality</li><li>Flexible scaling options for varying business sizes</li><li>Clear, actionable status monitoring for number pools</li><li>Simplified onboarding process for new users</li></ul><h2>Research and Development Process</h2><p>Our methodology combined both qualitative and quantitative approaches:</p><h3>Qualitative Instruments</h3><ul><li>Stakeholder interviews with key team members</li><li>User feedback sessions (external and internal)</li><li>Interface usability testing</li></ul><h3>Quantitative Measurements</h3><ul><li>Setup time metrics before and after implementation</li><li>Support ticket volume analysis</li><li>User satisfaction surveys during beta testing</li></ul><h2>Deliverables and Outcomes</h2><p>The project resulted in several key deliverables:</p><ul><li>Redesigned number pool management interface</li><li>Streamlined setup wizard for new pool creation</li><li>Enhanced monitoring dashboard</li></ul><p>Key performance indicators showed significant improvements:</p><ul><li>30% reduction in number management-related support tickets during Q3 2024</li><li>95% positive feedback from beta testing participants</li></ul><p>These metrics were gathered through our internal analytics tools and feedback collection systems between Q1 and Q2 2024, with final validation completed during the UI testing phase in April 2024.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/qualitative-research">qualitative research</a></li><li><a href="/tags/quantitative-research">quantitative research</a></li></ul></article><footer><p>Portfolio made in Swift (yes, Swift!) using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish" target="_blank">Publish</a>.
