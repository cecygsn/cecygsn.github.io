This project started in early July 2021 and ended in the last weeks of August.</p><h2>Context</h2><p>When we first contacted the team at the Waltham Public Library, we had an initial video call which consisted in discussing the current website, their internal goals and pains, as well as getting a grasp on their experience with human-centered design.</p><p>After this, the team got together to write down the study design and scope of this project. In order to identify the main goals to focus on, we had the chance to look into some heat maps for the most used pages on the website, which helped us identify main use cases, and analytics information, which we used to inform our user profile, including device type, use cases, language, and more.</p><p>We communicated the logistics, study plan and goals to the sponsor via a Statement of Work document, which was approved and signed by both parties. The main research question we agreed to address was:</p><blockquote><p>What difficulties do users have navigating and locating services on the library website?</p></blockquote><p>In order to understand the Waltham Library website patrons better, we developed a set of three user personas.</p><img src="john-persona.png" alt="A user persona profile for John Parker, a novice user. John is a 17-year-old male who recently moved from California to Waltham and attends Waltham High School. He works part-time at Starbucks and is preparing for college applications. His library use includes studying and working on college applications, with a preference for audiobooks and digital books. John is a mobile-first user, relying on his iPhone and Safari browser for accessing resources. His goals involve obtaining a library card, accessing audiobooks, conducting research, using library spaces, and seeking a tutor. Frustrations include navigating a cluttered website on mobile devices, challenges in academic research, and anxiety about college applications."/><img src="martin-persona.png" alt="A user persona profile for Martín Rodriguez, a 65-year-old male. Martín recently moved to Waltham for medical convenience. He is a retiree and fluent Spanish speaker with limited English understanding, uses a wheelchair, and prefers physical books with large print. Martín is a desktop-first user, depends on library computers, and often needs caregiver assistance. His goals include finding books, interacting with the community, and learning English. He faces challenges like mobility issues, transportation difficulties, language barriers, and loneliness."/><img src="rose-persona.png" alt="A user persona profile for Rose, a 40-year-old female. Rose Mccormick is a lifelong Waltham resident, and a mid-level manager at an insurance company. She is married with three children aged 15, 11, and 6, visits the library weekly, prefers physical books, and is active in library events. Rose is a desktop-first user utilizing the Firefox browser and views the library website as an extension of her visits. Her goals include reserving books, finding age-appropriate resources for her children, and exploring volunteer opportunities. Her frustrations include time constraints, missing in-person book club meetings, and seeking events for her family."/><p>Alongside with our personas, we created an exploratory interview study, where we gathered a group of 10 of participants fitting each of our personas, and asked them about their use patterns inside the library website, as well as their unmet feature needs and some use case scenarios.</p><p>Gathering our notes from the exploratory interview sessions, we compiled our data into a notes grid to collaboratively analyze it. We processed the data and organized it into positive and negative comments, as well as comments specifically on the information architecture and structure of the website.</p><h2>Methodology</h2><h3>Interviews</h3><p>All interviews were conducted through June using Zoom. The 11 people who were interviewed were a mix of library patrons, personal contacts, as well as other volunteers collected through a survey.</p><h4>Participants and Characteristics</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Categories</th><th>Demographics</th><th>Percentage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age</td><td>65+</td><td>45%</td></tr><tr><td>Race and Ethnicity</td><td>White</td><td>72%</td></tr><tr><td>Resident</td><td>Waltham local</td><td>54%</td></tr><tr><td>Language Preference</td><td>English</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Main Transportation</td><td>Car</td><td>72%</td></tr><tr><td>Persona</td><td>Parent</td><td>50%</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table 1.</strong> <em>Demographics of our interview and data sort study</em></p><h3>Interview Process</h3><ul><li>The interviews were conducted over Zoom for approximately an hour with a single interviewer and interviewee and occasionally observers from the team.</li><li>Interviewees were asked some questions pertaining to their lives, use of technology, and use of the library such as “If you were to visit your local library’s website, what device would you be more likely to use? A desktop, a tablet, or a smartphone?” and “Do you have any children or teens who are involved in the youth groups that the Waltham Library hosts or that your local library hosts?”</li><li>In terviewees were asked to visit the library page and were asked questions such as “Can you describe to me what you see on the front page?” and “Let’s say that you are interested to know more about a hobby of yours. How would you look for something about that on this website?”</li><li>At the end, Interviewees were asked to fill out a SUS questionnaire about their experience using the site.</li></ul><h3>Interview data analysis</h3><p>In order to process the interviews, we used a spreadsheet where we transcribed participant’s answers and color-coded positive findings and usability issues. After coding, these items were discussed in a group, where we determined which were the most common topics, both in positive aspects and areas of improvement.</p><img src="sus.png" alt="Presentation of System Usability Scale (SUS) scores, showing results from 11 responses with an average score of 64.5. The layout includes a survey form with questions rated from strongly disagree to strongly agree, a chart comparing SUS scores of various items like Google search and pregnancy tests, and a table converting survey responses into numerical data. A prominent green circle highlights the overall score, emphasizing usability assessment results."/><h3>Card sort</h3><p>In order to complement interview findings with more reliable quantitative data, we did a series of 13 remote, semi-moderated, card sort exercises. In these sessions, we showed participants a Mural board with all current sections on the website and instructed participants to arrange them as needed.</p><p>Resulting data was processed in order to find levels of agreements between categories and pages. These agreement scores were the main basis of our proposed Information Architecture restructuring.</p><img src="card-sort.webp" alt="A data chart illustrating correlations between various library-related categories and card names. Columns represent categories such as Events, Services &amp; Resources, and Kids. Each card name has associated percentages indicating correlation strength, with darker shades of blue representing higher correlations. The chart includes additional columns for the highest correlation, categories for each card, and agreement levels. The data visualizes the relationship between different library services and user interaction."/><h3>Defining the site tree</h3><p>Aggregating both qualitative and quantitative methods we built a site tree.</p><img src="site-tree.png" alt="A proposed site tree for a library, categorized into sections like About, Collections, Events, Home, Services &amp; Resources, and Kids &amp; Teens. Entries include "Book Club Event Calendar," "Local History &amp; Genealogy," "Digital Media &amp; e-books," "Study Rooms &amp; Meeting Rooms," and "Kids Programs." The tree uses shades of blue to indicate agreement rates, ranging from high to very low, providing a structured navigation plan for the library's website."/><h3>Recommendations</h3><p>Finally, based on the findings from both the SUS survey, exploratory interviews, and card sorts, the team structured a list of recommendations for the Waltham Library website. These recommendations were grouped in three different categories; Usability, Aesthetics, and Strategic.</p><p>Usability recommendations included mainly implementing our proposed Information Architecture, fixing some layout issues, and addressing some usability issues which were found by interviewees.</p><img src="usability-recs.webp" alt="A table listing usability recommendations with categories like search bar hint, clear navigation items, and redesigning event calendars, showing average importance and severity with high, medium, and low priorities. {strategic-recommendations.png} A table presenting strategic recommendations for the library website, including establishing a user base, offering book clubs for kids, and encouraging real-time feedback, with priorities labeled as high or medium severity."/><p>Aesthetics recommendations were based on our observations from what other big library websites were doing, some comments gathered during interviews, and finding a compelling color palette from a mood board.</p><img src="aesthetics-recs.png" alt="A table listing aesthetic recommendations with a focus on improving visual elements. Categories include use of hero images, imagery, multiple color schemes, community focus, limiting white space, quick link visibility, and highlighting events. Each recommendation is rated by average importance and severity, using a scale where 1 is most important, 2 is important, and 3 is least important. Severity levels are color-coded, indicating high (red), medium (orange), and low (green) priorities."/><p>Strategic recommendations included some first steps the WPL team can adapt to start growing a user-oriented feedback loop, such as gathering a user pool to conduct future studies and integrating different departments inside the UX-loop.</p><img src="strategic-recs.png" alt="A table presenting strategic recommendations for the library website, including establishing a user base, offering book clubs for kids, testing new website iterations, and encouraging real-time feedback, with high and medium severity levels indicated."/><h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2><p>The totality of this study was conducted remotely, with a remotely located team and remote sessions. Team members and participants were also distributed between time zones and each had their own weekly personal commitments. Thankfully, the team was able to commit weekly for a checkpoint meeting, and we all had a robust workload, where everyone contributed and had explicit deadlines. Recruiting participants was also an issue, and the team at the Waltham Library had a great idea of placing recruitment cards inside some books for patrons to find. Also, some team members were also able to recruit different people from surveys, which were distributed through UX-centered communities.</p><p>Another big task was to do the Card Sort exercise and analysis successfully, as the team had little practical experience doing them. However, we were able to learn from a fellow team member with more experience on the topic, and had a guide about how to analyze and process the data.</p><p>The aforementioned challenges made the project go over its original scheduled time by around 3 weeks, finishing with our presentation to the WPL team in late August instead of the end of July as previously foreseen.</p><h2>Outcome</h2><p>Our team had great opportunities to develop new techniques and acquire new knowledge, as well as improving our teamwork and other soft skills. We are very grateful to the Waltham Public Library for letting us endeavor this project together, and specially to our internal stakeholder Todd S., who very kindly wrote us a short recommendation letter, placed below.</p><blockquote><p>I, along with the library, are very fortunate that Yo reached out to us. He chose a great team that provided the library with an extraordinary amount of feedback along with a detailed prioritized list of what we need to do to improve the usability of our website. This list consists of changes that range from simple to others that will take some time to implement. They all did a fantastic job of working together, professionally presenting their findings to us, and explaining the importance of these changes based on their findings. – Todd S.</p></blockquote></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list" aria-label="tag"><li><a href="/tags/information-architecture">information architecture</a></li><li><a href="/tags/persona-creation">persona creation</a></li><li><a href="/tags/qualitative-interviews">qualitative interviews</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Portfolio made in Swift (yes, Swift!) using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish" target="_blank">Publish</a>.
