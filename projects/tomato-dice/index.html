In response, the Tomato Dice, a multimodal device, attempts to provide a fun way for people to take more effective breaks amid work through timeboxing. After the dice is rolled, each side plays visual and audio feedback helping users to either work for a set amount of time or take a break away from their work screens. In this paper, we discussed the design process and the different modes of the dice. We also conducted a heuristic evaluation followed by a usability study which revealed that participants were mostly fascinated with the dice and were more likely to use the Tomato Dice to relax than to take breaks.</p><p>The Tomato Dice was a project developed during the course of approximately one year. The project went from ideation, prototype creation, and the team later published their findings as a research paper.</p><img src="functional-analysis.webp" alt="A flowchart titled "High-Level Functional Analysis" for a device called "Tomato Dice." The chart includes blocks representing different functions, such as Initializer, Mode Selector, Pomodoro 25 min side, Timer, Position Analyzer, and Idle Mode. Connectors indicate processes like reading instructions, mode selection, execution, and shutdown. The legend shows types of flow: energy, material, and information. Inputs and outputs engage with components like an LED Matrix and voice, emphasizing interactive functionality and mode execution."/><p><strong>Figure 1</strong> <em>Functional Analysis of the Prototype</em></p><img src="storyboard-v1.webp" alt="Storyboard version 1.

The sketches illustrate the process with elements like light signals and speech prompts."/><img src="storyboard-v2-2.jpg" alt="Storyboard iteration, second of two pages.

The poster outlines the objectives, highlighting the device's role in providing effective, timed relaxation modes. The design is a tangible, playful dice that offers engagement through randomization, known as the "Pleasure Paradox." Details of experiments involving user feedback are included, identifying themes around interactions and suggested improvements like customization, volume control, a countdown timer, and Bluetooth. Six modes—Breathing, Ocean, Timer, Muscle Relaxation, Dance, and Workout—are featured. Pie charts display participant emotions, and images show the device components. The poster also includes Bentley University branding."/><h2>Learnings</h2><p>The results of the study revealed issues such as confusion over some instructional audio and visual cues. Our results showed that participants mostly reported being fascinated by the dice. They also conveyed a higher likelihood to use it for relaxation than taking breaks. While the visual and audio playbacks of the dice may be relaxing, it is not as content-heavy as other online media.</p><img src="thematic-analysis.png" alt="A concept map for a relaxation device highlights key features and experiences. Tangible interaction includes attributes such as being malleable, intuitive, and having a smooth texture, setting it apart from screens. The audio component offers volume control and incorporates voice/music, with options for headphone or mute use depending on the scenario. Visual elements are designed to be relaxing and fun to watch, with speed controls and examples of effective and ineffective visuals. Available modes focus on customization, meditation, exercises, and dance, with considerations for additional options and space. Dice usage encourages taking breaks from work, is beneficial after stressful meetings, and serves as a preferable alternative to social media when bored or frustrated. Each section is color-coded and interconnects related ideas and applications."/><p><strong>Figure 4</strong> <em>Thematic Analysis results</em></p><p>Based on the usability study, other improvements include allowing the user to customize the cube, adding volume control, adding a countdown on the timer mode, and adding Bluetooth. All participants reported that they would use the cube less if they were working in an office because they would not want to disturb others. The cube could have additional modes that would be optimized to help users feel comfortable using the Tomato Dice in a shared workspace. For example, there could be a silent mode for users whose work is no longer remote. Some participants also suggested adding some elements of humor, adding more sensations to the cube, and making it more ‘hands-on’, such as being able to manipulate it freely while it is in Work Mode.</p><p>Considering that the dice will be thrown around, we would also need to explore ways that the material and design of the cube would reduce any impact on its electrical components.</p><h2>Outcomes</h2><p>This project was presented virtually during the ICMI Conference on Octobre 20th, 2021.
